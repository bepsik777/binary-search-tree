# binary-search-tree

This is a JS implementation of a balanced binary search tree for the odin project: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-binary-search-trees

What i had the most difficulties with? 
I think the most difficult part for me was the height method implemention, as it was the most abstract and multithreaded task to accomplish, and i needed to see other resources to get an idea how to implement it. 

To see it working, just run the driver.js file in a browser and check the console.
